            <h1>NATIONAL SERVICE SCHEME (NSS)</h1>
            <p>The National Service Scheme (NSS) is an Indian government-sponsored public service program conducted by
                the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports of the Government of India. Popularly known as NSS, the scheme
                was launched in Gandhiji's Centenary year in 1969. Aimed at developing student's personality through
                community service, NSS is a voluntary association of young people in Colleges, Universities and at +2
                level working for a campus-community (esp. Villages) linkage.</p>
            <h2>Aim:</h2>
            <p>The programme aims to install the idea of social welfare in students, and to provide service to society
                without bias. NSS volunteers work to ensure that everyone who is needy gets help to enhance their
                standard of living and lead a life of dignity. In doing so, volunteers learn from people in villages how
                to lead a good life despite a scarcity of resources it also provides help in natural and man-made
                disasters by providing food, clothing and first aid to the disaster's victims.</p>
            <h2>Types of Activities:</h2>
            <p>There are two types of activities: Regular Activities(120 hours) and Annual Special Camp(120 hours). All
                the NSS Volunteers who have served NSS for at least 2 years and have performed 240 hours of work under
                NSS are entitled to a certificate from the university under the signature of the Vice-Chancellor and the
                Programme Coordinator. The Annual camps are known as Special Camps. Camps are held annually, funded by
                the government of India, and are usually located in a rural village or a city suburb. Volunteers may be
                involved in such activities as:<br>
            1. Cleaning<br>
            2. Afforestation<br>
            3. Stage shows or a procession creating awareness of such issues as social problems, education and
            cleanliness<br>
            4. Awareness Rallies<br>
            5. Inviting doctors for health camps<br>
            There are no predefined or preassigned tasks; it is left up to the volunteers to provide service in any way
            that is feasible. Camps typically last between a week and 10 days, although camps for shorter periods are
            also conducted by NSS.</p>
